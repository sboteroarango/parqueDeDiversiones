This is a project that mimics the functionality of an amusement park.
This allows you to:
1. register park employees
2. register new attractions
3. buy handles 
4. recharge handles
5. show the information of the attractions
6. make a client enter an attraction
7. show the information of the registered clients
8. generate a final report with the total earnings, total entries, earnings per attraction and entries per attraction

## some considerations

-Some attractions have entrance discounts or additional charges depending on the age of the user and the times that he or she had entered to the attraction

-The main file is ParqueDiversiones.cs
